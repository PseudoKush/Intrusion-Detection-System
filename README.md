The aim of this system is to Detect Intrusion in a network using Machine Learning.   
  
About Dataset:  
Dataset Source: The BoT-IoT Dataset (https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/bot_iot.php)  
Dataset Used: 10-best features (5% of BoT-IoT dataset)

The BoT-IoT dataset was created by designing a realistic network environment in the Cyber Range Lab of The center of UNSW Canberra Cyber. The environment incorporates a combination of normal and botnet traffic. The datasetâ€™s source files are provided in different formats, including the original pcap files, the generated argus files and csv files. The files were separated, based on attack category and subcategory, to better assist in labeling process.  
We have used the 5% of the dataset to create our ML model. It contains 10 best features for training and testing dataset. This dataset has 19 columns with category and subcategory as the target columns and over 2.9 million rows.
